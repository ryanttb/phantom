Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace: The Abridged Game
=======

This is a silly point & click adventure game based on Phantom Menace and done in and NES Shadowgate/gold box style.

It takes inspiration (and most dialog) from The Editing Room's "STAR WARS: EPISODE I - THE PHANTOM MENACE - The Abridged Script" with consent from Rod of The Editing Room!

I wrote a whole engine to do this, but only produced one story.

It was also my submission to An Event Apart's JavaScript 10k competition in 2010.
